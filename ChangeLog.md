# ChangeLog

## NEXT

  * New command `ey init` writes or updates an ey.yml configuration file to help users understand all the ey.yml options.
    * `ey init` is recommended for all applications to provide extra documentation in ey.yml.
  * New command `ey servers -e env` shows servers for a specified environment in a machine/user readable format.
  * `ey ssh` accepts new options -t and --each. Experimintal option -L is also supported.
  * Uses newest version of engineyard-serverside 2.3.1
    * Abort rollbacks if unexpected files are found in the /data/app/releases/ directory because they disrupt the ability to find the previous and latest releases.
    * Supports alternative deploy strategy that fetches an archive at a remote URI and expands it. (Not yet supported from the command line)
    * Changes the name of the Strategy class to Source::Git.
    * Supports ey.yml options `bundler`, `npm`, and `composer` which can be set to false to disable that dependency manager during deploy.

## v2.2.1 (2013-07-29)

  * Uses newest version of engineyard-serverside 2.2.1
    * Fixes deprecation warnings for internal method calls in deploy hooks.

## v2.2.0 (2013-07-25)

  * Send `deployed_by` and `input_ref` information with rollback (no ref is input so `input_ref` only has a placeholder value)
  * When ey.yml loads as anything other than a Hash, raise an error telling the user that ey.yml is malformed.
  * Uses newest version of engineyard-serverside 2.2.0
    * Updates fallback bundler version to latest v1.3.5.
    * Supports using multiple dependency managers at the same time (bundler, composer, and/or npm)
    * Replaces command runner to address streaming log, idle connection, and random systemu failures.
    * Adds `config/application.rb` to the `asset_dependencies` to trigger asset precompilation.
    * Removes syncing of file modification times during push code operation in deploy. Syncing times occasionally causes unfixable permissions errors.
    * Clarifies inferred asset warning message.
    * Improves some of the maintenance page status messages.
    * Removes poorly encapsulated methods `config.enable_maintenance\_page?` and `config.disable_maintenance_page?`. Relocated to Maintenance class. (Check eydeploy.rb files)
    * Removes deprecated `c` method (use `config` instead)
    * In deploy hooks, deprecates @configuration (use `config`), @node (use `config.node`), and method\_missing access of config methods (use `config.method`).

## v2.1.3 (2013-06-17)

  * Uses newest version of engineyard-serverside 2.1.4
    * Doesn't reuse assets when assets were not compiled last deployment.
    * Improves composer support.
  * Supports new flag `--shell (-s)` for `ey ssh` which allows you to choose the shell that runs the command. (default: bash) Has no effect on `ey ssh` without a command.
  * Supports new flag `--no-shell` to run the `ey ssh` command without a shell. (this is the standard behavior of the unix ssh command) Has no effect on `ey ssh` without a command.

## v2.1.2 (2013-06-05)

  * Uses newest version of engineyard-serverside 2.1.3
    * Fixes a formatting error in sqlite database.yml files.
    * Patches LANG gem install error.

  * Use newest deployment version that patches a problem with calling Set#first on some ruby versions.

## v2.1.0 (2013-05-28)

  * Add a new command `ey timeout-deploy` which will mark stuck deploys as canceled.
  * Bumps default bundler version to latest 1.3.4
  * During deploy, doesn't precompile assets when git-diff shows no changes to `asset_dependencies`
  * Supports new ey.yml option `asset_dependencies` which is a list of relative paths to search for asset changes each deploy.
    * The default `asset_dependencies` are: app/assets lib/assets vendor/assets Gemfile.lock config/routes.rb
  * Supports new ey.yml option `precompile_unchanged_assets: true` compiles assets even if no changes would be detected.
  * Supports new ey.yml option `precompile_assets_task: taskname` which overrides the default `assets:precompile`
  * Supports new ey.yml option `asset_strategy` which supports: `shared`, `private`, `cleaning`, or `shifting`.
    * The default asset strategy is `shifting` which is the same behavior as previous versions.
    * See `README.markdown` or [`lib/engineyard-serverside/rails_assets/strategy.rb`](https://github.com/engineyard/engineyard-serverside/blob/master/lib/engineyard-serverside/rails_assets/strategy.rb) for full explanation.
  * Supports new ey.yml option `bundle_options` which can be used to specify additional bundle install command line options.
  * Supports setting of ey.yml option `bundle_without` to nil to remove `--without` from the bundle install command.
  * Refactor dependency management (bundler, npm, none) to allow more flexibility (may break existing eydeploy.rb files)
  * Supports new ey.yml option `eydeploy_rb: false` which enables or disables eydeploy.rb file loading. (default: load eydeploy.rb)
  * Changes the order of eydeploy.rb loading to happen after ey.yml is parsed during deploy.
  * Fixes a race condition during deploy where `current` symlink was not moved atomically.

## v2.0.12 (2013-04-11)

  * Uses new version of engineyard-serverside 2.0.6 with the following bug fixes:
    * Fix for command line config option `--config precompile_assets:true/false` which was being interpreted as a string.
    * Don't exclude the `RAILS_ENV` Gemfile group from bundle install. (i.e. don't do `--without development` in `development` mode)

## v2.0.11 (2013-02-12)

  * New version of `engineyard-serverside` which includes:
    * Change concurrency code to use a simple threaded model (faster deploys on some instances)

## v2.0.10 (2012-12-17)

  * Command line option -q (or --quiet) mutes non-essential CLI output for most commands.
  * Uses new version 2.0.4 of the deploy system.
  * Supports new ey.yml option during deploy to control on which roles asset precompilation happens.
    * Follows YAML Array syntax (using :app, :app\_master, :solo, :util) or :all.
    * Syntax: `asset_roles: :all (default is to exclude :util but include all others. [:app, :app_master, :solo])`
  * During deploy, adds `RAILS_GROUPS=assets` to rake assets:precompile to improve asset compilation performance.

  * Alias --extra-deploy-hook-options as --config for easier usage.

## v2.0.6 (2012-09-19)

  * During deploy, only symlink shared config files that actually exist.
  * During deploy, don't display the database adapter warning when the environment does not have a database.
  * During deploy, chown shared/bundled\_gems dir to deploy user to ensure bundle install works.

  * Use new serverside-adapter that allows setting engineyard-serverside version separately.

## v2.0.2 (2012-08-24)

  *

## v2.0.1 (2012-08-21)

  * Allows `--app`, `--account`, and `--environment` for `ey environments` for extra filtering.
  * Prints an error when a command line option, like `--environment`, is specified without an argument.
  * No longer guesses migration behavior. ey.yml must contain `migrate: true # or false` for each environment. ey deploy will walk you through on your first deploy.
  * Adds command `ey web restart` to restart application servers without deploying.
  * New version of `engineyard-serverside` (and adapter), which includes:
    * Default bundler version is now 1.1.5.

      * `maintenance_on_migrate: true or false (default: true)`
    * Don't remove maintenance pages that weren't put up during this deploy if maintenance options (above) are set to false.
    * Supports new ey.yml options to control asset precompilation:
      * `precompile_assets: true or false (default: inferred using app/assets and config/application.rb)`
    * Supports new ey.yml option to ignore the missing database adapter warning:
      * `ignore_database_adapter_warning: true (default: false)`
    * Fixes a bug that could cause Passenger to restart multiple times during each deploy.

## v1.4.17 (2011-12-28)

  * Force encoding on commands going across Net::SSH (which seems incapable of handling UTF-8 encoded strings)
  * Diagnostic code for command encoding when running in verbose mode.

  * Upgrade to latest net-ssh to fix string encoding issues in 1.9.x.

## v1.4.15 (2011-12-14)

  * Add support for $ENGINEYARD\_API\_TOKEN on the command line to override token fetching.
  * Fix lingering AppCloud mentions.

  * Put more information in the deploy logs so failing deploys show something.
  * Expose deployed\_by user name in deploy hooks.
  * Handle not found when accessing deployment api before deploying.

  * [refactor] More require, less autoload
  * [refactor] Clean up the way we read and write the .eyrc file.
  * [internal] Specs no longer depend on FakeFS.
  * [internal] Remove unused 'custom endpoint' complexity. $CLOUD\_URL can still be set to override the api endpoint.

## v1.4.7 (2011-11-16)

  * Exit from ey ssh with the exit status of the ssh command. If running on multiple instances, exits with the status of the first failure, or 0 if all instances succeed.
