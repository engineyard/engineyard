        This is similar to '#{banner_base} rebuild' except Engine Yard's main
        configuration step is skipped.

        The cookbook uploaded by the 'recipes upload' command will be run when
        you run 'recipes apply'.

        current directory. This is the opposite of 'recipes upload'.

        If the cookbooks directory already exists, an error will be raised.
