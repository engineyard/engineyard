        This is similar to '#{banner_base} rebuild' except Engine Yard's main
        configuration step is skipped.

        The cookbook uploaded by the '#{banner_base} recipes upload' command will be run when
        you run '#{banner_base} recipes apply'.

        Make an archive of the "cookbooks/" subdirectory in your current working
        directory and upload it to Engine Yard Cloud's recipe storage.

        Alternatively, specify a .tgz of a cookbooks/ directory yourself as follows:

        $ #{banner_base} recipes upload -f path/to/recipes.tgz

        The uploaded cookbooks will be run when executing '#{banner_base} recipes apply'
        and also automatically each time you update/rebuild your instances.
